   <h4>New school canteen</h4>
   <img src="canteen.jpg"  class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">All the corridors of the school should lead to the canteen but unfortunately, it is in a corner of the school. It has a small window through which the canteen incharge supplies us snacks, tea and cold drink. Our principal has allowed a stall of ice cream in the canteen. There are two other counters for books, stationery and beverages. It is mostly the parents who visit the stationery counter. The students go there only under compulsion. Their most favourite spot is the ice cream corner. The students flock round it and buy the ice creams that are available in different flavours.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The Attendance Matters Spotlight report also reinforces how crucial it is to ensure students feel welcome, safe and supported at school, and encouraged to attend.

    The evidence summary indicates that the overall school attendance picture in Australia is good, with year 1-10 students attending, on average, 92% of available school days in Australia â€“ a rate comparable to other countries with high performing education systems.
    
    Areas of concern, however, include that 25% of Australian school students attend less than 90% of school days, and that school attendance decreases as remoteness increases.
    
    The report also identifies that there remains a notable difference in attendance rates between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and non-Indigenous students. In 2018, the overall national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander attendance rate was 82.3% compared to 92.5% for non-Indigenous students. This shows that there is still much more work to do to lift attendance rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.</p>
